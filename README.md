## Introduction
Test  Help




For our analysis, we chose to explore what types of recipes tend to have the most recipes and predict the amount of calories in a given recipe. 
Our analysis is helpful for readers who are looking for a recipe that fits their dietary goals. Our analysis is a great tool for readers who are looking for people looking to gain weight in the form of lean muscle mass or energy. Calories are units of energy that every individual needs for their body to function. 

The two csv datasets we are working with are Raw Recipes and Raw Interactions. Raw recipes contains recipes and Raw_interactions contains the reviews and ratings submitted for the recipes in RAW_recipes. Both of the recipes are from Food.com.Food.com is a digital brand and media platform that features a large collection of recipes that are submitted, rated, and reviewed by foodies including home cooks, celebrity chefs, and shows. These data sets only contains recipes posted since 2008

The columns relevant to our question are protein, sugar, n_steps, minutes, sodium, saturated fat, minutes, total fat, sugar, and carbohydrates, recipe id.

## Assessment of Missingness

Here's what a Markdown table looks like. Note that the code for this table was generated _automatically_ from a DataFrame, using

```py
print(counts[['Quarter', 'Count']].head().to_markdown(index=False))
```

| Quarter     |   Count |
|:------------|--------:|
| Fall 2020   |       3 |
| Winter 2021 |       2 |
| Spring 2021 |       6 |
| Summer 2021 |       4 |
| Fall 2021   |      55 |
